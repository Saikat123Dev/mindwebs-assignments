## üìù Design and Development Remarks

### **Architecture**

- The application is built with a **component-based architecture**, where each part of the UI is a self-contained and reusable component (e.g., `ReactMap`, `TimelineSlider`, `PolygonSidebar`).
- **State Management**: React's built-in **Context API** is used for global state management. This choice is ideal for the application's scale, as it avoids the complexity of larger state management libraries like Redux while providing a centralized way to manage shared state (polygons, time range, etc.).

### **Styling**

- **TailwindCSS** was chosen for its utility-first approach, which allows for rapid and consistent styling directly within the JSX. This improves developer velocity and makes it easy to maintain a consistent design system.
- The `TimelineSlider` component features a sophisticated design with **gradient backgrounds, custom animations, and interactive tooltips**, all implemented using TailwindCSS utility classes. This demonstrates the power and flexibility of Tailwind for creating complex and beautiful UI elements without writing custom CSS.

### **Data Fetching and Handling**

- Asynchronous data fetching is handled by `fetch` , with robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.
- The `fetchWeather.ts` utility encapsulates the logic for fetching and processing weather data, including filtering data by time range and calculating averages. This separation of concerns makes the data fetching logic reusable and easy to test.

### **Map Interaction**

- **Leaflet** was chosen for its lightweight nature and extensive plugin ecosystem.
- `react-leaflet` provides a declarative API for using Leaflet within a React application.
- `leaflet-draw` allows users to draw polygons on the map, which then trigger data fetching and visualization for the selected area.

### **User Experience**

- The application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a focus on providing immediate visual feedback.
- Features like the animated timeline slider, interactive tooltips, and responsive design contribute to a polished and professional user experience.
